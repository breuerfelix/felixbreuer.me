# sveltite

this is a bundler made with sapper and svelte to make your own little website.
just remove all files from the `guides` and `projects` folder to match your own content.  
edit `index.svelte` to match your landing page.  
change `core/config.js` with your settings.

run `npm run export` to generate the output.

## TODO

- style markdown properly
